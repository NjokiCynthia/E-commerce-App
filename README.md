# Product Options and Variants Flutter App

This Flutter app allows users to add product options and generate product variants. The focus is on the User Interface (UI) and logic for capturing product option names and values, and then generating the variants when the user is done entering the product options.

## Features

- Product Name: Start by entering the product name.
- Product Description: Enter a product description.
- Product Options: Add multiple product options, such as size, color, or material.
- Option Values: For each product option, you can add multiple values (e.g., Small, Medium, Large for Size).
- Generate Variants: Once all options and values are added, the app generates all possible variants for the product.
- User-Friendly Interface: The app provides an intuitive interface for adding and removing options and values.

## How It Works

1. Enter Product Name:
   - Users begin by entering the product name.
  
2. Enter Product Description:
   - Users can enter the product description.
   
3. Add Product Options:
   - Users can add options like "Size" or "Color." Each option can have multiple values, such as "Small, Medium, Large" for Size.
   
4. Generate Variants:
   - Once options are added, the app automatically generates all possible combinations (variants) of those options.

5. Remove Values:
   - Users can remove any added value using the delete (cancel) icon.

## Example

For a T-shirt product:
- Option 1: Size with values Small, Medium, Large.
- Option 2: Color with values Red, Blue, Green.

The app will generate variants like:
- Small-Red
- Small-Blue
- Small-Green
- Medium-Red
